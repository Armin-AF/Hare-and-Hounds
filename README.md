# Hare and Hounds

This classic two-player strategy board game was popular in medieval northern Europe until the 19th century. It’s also known by many other names, such as the Soldier’s Game, the French Military Game, and The Devil Among Tailors [1].

(At start, the board is set up as shown below)

To begin play, you first have to pick a side: hare or hounds. 

Hounds:

Movement: The hounds are restricted and can only move in one direction (never backwards), from one space to another adjacent space. We’ll be starting the hounds on the left side, which means the hounds can only move diagonally or directly to the right, or up and down in one column (never to the left).
Goal: Trap the hare so it can’t make any moves (i.e., on a space that can be surrounded by 3 hounds with no adjacent open spaces).
Note: If the hounds move vertically 10 moves in a row, it’s considered “stalling” and the hare wins.
Hare:
Movement: Hares can move in any way they want – even backwards! However, the hare (ironically) can’t “hop” over the hounds. It must move from one space to another adjacent space just like the hounds.
Goal: Escape the hounds and reach the leftmost space on the board. If the hare passes the leftmost hound on the board, it automatically wins since the hounds can’t move backward to trap it! [2].
