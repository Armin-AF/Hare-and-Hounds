# Hare and Hounds

This classic two-player abstract strategy board game was popular in medieval northern Europe until the 19th century. In this game, a hare is trying to get past three dogs who are trying to surround it and trap it. The three dogs are represented by three pieces which normally start on one end of the board, and the hare is represented by one piece that usually starts in the middle of the board or is dropped on any vacant point in the beginning of the game.[1].  

## Alternate Names  

French Military Game, The Soldier's Game, Game of Dwarfs, The Devil Among Tailors, Haretavl (Denmark), Hare och Hund (Sweden), Trevolpa (Sweden), Volpalejden (Sweden).

To begin play, you first have to pick a side: hare or hounds. 

### Hounds    

Movement: The hounds are restricted and can only move in one direction (never backwards), from one space to another adjacent space. We’ll be starting the hounds on the left side, which means the hounds can only move diagonally or directly to the right, or up and down in one column (never to the left).
Goal: Trap the hare so it can’t make any moves (i.e., on a space that can be surrounded by 3 hounds with no adjacent open spaces).
Note: If the hounds move vertically 10 moves in a row, it’s considered “stalling” and the hare wins.  

### Hare  

Movement: Hares can move in any way they want – even backwards! However, the hare (ironically) can’t “hop” over the hounds. It must move from one space to another adjacent space just like the hounds.
Goal: Escape the hounds and reach the leftmost space on the board. If the hare passes the leftmost hound on the board, it automatically wins since the hounds can’t move backward to trap it! [2].
